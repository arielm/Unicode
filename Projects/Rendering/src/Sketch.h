/*
 * DONE:
 *
 * 1) MOVING LangHelper TO FontManager AND PROVIDING PROXY TO LayoutCache IN VirtualFont
 *
 * 2) VirtualFont: ADDING MEANS OF OBTAINING ActualFont::Metrics (E.G. FROM A GIVEN Cluster)
 *
 * 3) TextItemizer::processLine():
 *    - DIRECTION IS NOW UNDEFINED BY DEFAULT:
 *      - IN THIS CASE, THE "PARAGRAPH-LEVEL" WILL BE DETERMINED FROM THE TEXT (VIA BIDI)
 *        AND THE RESULTING LineLayout WILL RECEIVE AN overallDirection VALUE
 *    - LIKEWISE, IF LANGUAGE IS UNDEFINED:
 *      - THE RESULTING LineLayout WILL RECEIVE A langHint VALUE BASED
 *        ON THE LANGUAGE DETECTED FOR THE FIRST RUN
 *
 * 4) FIXING REGRESSION (INTRODUCED IN COMMIT 604c7ab) AFFECTING (AT LEAST) HEBREW AND THAI
 *
 * 5) "COMPOSITE METRICS" FOR VirtualFont GIVEN A LineLayout:
 *    - getHeight() WILL RETURN THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT
 *    - getAscent() WILL RETURN THE MAXIMUM ASCENT
 *    - getDescent() WILL RETURN THE MAXIMUM DESCENT
 *    - getMiddleLine() WILL RETURN HALF OF getAscent() - getDescent():
 *      THIS IS LESS IDEAL THAN USING THE STRIKETHROUGH-OFFSET,
 *      BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE IN THE CASE OF A "COMPOSITE" LineLayout
 *
 * 6) API ADDITIONS / IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - ActualFont::getFullName()
 *    - VirtualFont::getCachedLineLayout()
 *
 * 7) SETTING DEFAULT COLOR FOR VirtualFont
 *
 * 8) FontManager::getFont()
 *    - FASTER LOOKUPS VIA THE shortcuts MAP
 *    - BASIC SYSTEM FOR HANDLING UNDEFINED FONT NAMES AND STYLES:
 *      - getFont() IS NOW SUPPOSED TO THROW ONLY UPON MALFORMED XML
 *        OR WHEN A FONT NAME/STYLE COMBINATION DOES NOT EXIST
 *        AND NO "DEFAULT FONT" HAS BEEN DEFINED
 *
 * 9) PREPARING THE TERRAIN FOR OPTIMIZED DRAWING:
 *    - DRAWING THE HORIZONTAL-LINES AND THE TEXT SEPARATELY
 *    - ONE SINGLE VirtualFont::begin() AND VirtualFont::end() PAIRS ARE USED
 *      - THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO USE A SYSTEM FOR GROUPING SIMILAR GLYPH TEXTURES...
 *    - USING glDrawArrays WITH INTERLEAVED "POSITIONS + TEXTURE-COORDS"
 *
 * 10) FontManager: POSSIBILITY TO QUERY "TEXTURE MEMORY USAGE"
 *
 * 11) LayoutCache: POSSIBILITY TO QUERY MEMORY USAGE AND TO CHANGE CAPACITY
 *
 * 12) FINE-TUNING:
 *     - FontManager::getCachedFont() METHODS ARE NOW RETURNING A shared_ptr<VirtualFont>:
 *       - AVOID RISK OF UN-NECESSARY COPY
 *       - NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROPERLY REMOVE VirtualFont INSTANCES (TBD)
 *     - FontManager::getCachedLineLayout() AND LayoutCache::getLineLayout() ARE NOW RETURNING A shared_ptr<LineLayout>:
 *       - AVOID RISK OF UN-NECESSARY COPY
 *       - THE CACHE WAS ALREADY USING A shared_ptr INTERNALLY
 *       - MORE ADAPTED TO THE NOTION OF CACHE, AND NOW CONSISTENT WITH FontManager::getCachedFont()
 *     - FINALLY FOUND A WAY TO USE PROTECTED CONSTRUCTORS FOR
 *       VirtualFont AND ActualFont (WHICH SHOULD BE CREATED ONLY VIA FontManager)
 *     - FontManager::loadGlobalMap() CAN ONLY BE CALLED ONCE (FURTHER ATTEMPTS WILL THROW...)
 *
 * 13) REDESIGN OF THE ActualFont ECO-SYSTEM:
 *     - FontManager::reload() HAS BEEN CANCELLED, SINCE FONT RESOURCES (HARFBUZZ AND FREETYPE RELATED)
 *       ARE NOW RELOADED ONLY WHEN NECESSARY (EITHER UPON LineLayout RENDERING OR CREATION)
 *     - PREVIOUSLY: AFTER CALLING FontManager::unload(), LineLayout RENDERING OR CREATION
 *       WAS SIMPLY NOT TAKING PLACE (I.E. UNTIL reload() IS CALLED),
 *       BUT THE SYSTEM CAN'T BE ADAPTED TO LAZY RELOADING
 *     - POSSIBILITY TO CALL FontManager::unload(...) PER VirtualFont:
 *       IT WILL CLEAR THE FONT RESOURCES (HARFBUZZ AND FREETYPE RELATED) AND DISCARD THE GLYPH TEXTURES
 *       ASSOCIATED SOLELY WITH THE VirtualFont
 *     - WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY LOAD (HARFBUZZ AND FREETYPE WISE) ALL
 *       THE ASSOCIATED ActualFont INSTANCES WHEN A NEW VirtualFont IS CREATED?
 *       A) FREETYPE IS ABLE TO DETERMINE IF A FONT IS OKAY ONLY AFTER LOADING IT
 *       B) THE VirtualFont XML-FONT DEFINITION IS DESIGNED IN A WAY WHICH REQUIRES
 *          TO KNOW IF A FONT IS OKAY (SEE THE Group CONSTRUCT)
 *       C) WE ARE CURRENTLY PRODUCING A PROPER FontSet FOR EACH LANGUAGE UPON VirtualFont
 *          CREATION, WHICH IS GREATLY SIMPLIFYING THE OPERATIONS
 *     - IF MEMORY REALLY MATTERS: IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO CALL FontManager::unload()
 *       RIGHT AFTER CREATING ALL YOUR VirtualFont INSTANCES
 *
 * 14) XML FORMAT REDESIGN:
 *     - REFACTORING TO Font::loadConfig()
 *     - "DEFAULT FONT" DEFINED IN FontConfig/DefaultFont:
 *       - CALLING FontManager::getFont() WITH SOME UNDEFINED
 *         NAME WILL RETURN THE "DEFAULT FONT"
 *     - ALIASES DEFINED IN FontConfig/Aliases, E.G.
 *       - "Arial" FOR "sans-serif"
 *       - "Times" FOR "serif"
 *
 * 15) DEVELOPMENT HAS MOVED TO THE new-chronotext-toolkit REPOSITORY (CURRENTLY IN SYNC WITH THE develop BRANCH):
 *     - NUMEROUS TWEAKS, BUT IN ESSENCE:
 *       - API UNIFICATION WITH THE XFont SYSTEM
 *       - POSSIBILITY TO DO BATCH-RENDERING

/*
 * ON iOS, WE'RE USING FONTS FROM THE "CACHE":
