The Unicode test suite for Cinder & C++11
=========================================

**Post mortem:** this project is no longer maintained.  

The outcome has been integrated in the [new-chronotext-toolkit](https://github.com/arielm/new-chronotext-toolkit), under the *ZFont* (aka *VirtualFont*) denomination.  

The 15 examples below still worth being visited. They provide valuable insights and allow to grasp the complexity and subtlety of international text rendering.

---

The goal is to provide building blocks for handling Unicode text rendering from the ground-up on OSX, iOS and Android (**Windows support should be trivial to add**, contributions are welcome...)  

**Topics of interest**

1. Glyph shaping
2. Font fallback
3. Layout caching
4. Script itemization
5. BIDI reordering
6. Line breaking
7. OpenGL rendering

[Freetype](http://www.freetype.org) should be used behind the scenes. In addition, existing quality open-source fonts should be evaluated, starting with [those bundled with the Android platform](fonts).

**Motivations and scope**

The goal is to provide support for internationalization in interactive applications and games created with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org). Currently, there is no appropriate cross-platform solution due the lack of public C++ API for text-rendering on Android. 

Take in count, however, that not all the features available in OS solutions like *CoreText* (or even in modern browsers) are going to be implemented.

**Progress**

So far, [Harfbuzz](https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz) and [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org) have been tested successfully via the following projects:

1. [CinderHarfbuzz](Projects/CinderHarfbuzz)
2. [ShapingTester](Projects/ShapingTester)
3. [ShapingMetrics](Projects/ShapingMetrics)
4. [FontComparator](Projects/FontComparator)
5. [LanguageFeatures](Projects/LanguageFeatures)
6. [ShapingFallback](Projects/ShapingFallback)
7. [SimpleBIDI](Projects/SimpleBIDI)
8. [SimpleVirtualFont](Projects/SimpleVirtualFont)
9. [SimpleLayoutCaching](Projects/SimpleLayoutCaching)
10. [SimpleRendering](Projects/SimpleRendering)
11. [ScriptDetector](Projects/ScriptDetector)
12. [BIDI](Projects/BIDI)
13. [LayoutCaching](Projects/LayoutCaching)
14. [VirtualFont](Projects/VirtualFont)
15. [Rendering](Projects/Rendering)

More work remains, notably with line-breaking and OpenGL rendering...

Installation
------------

The instructions are for OSX.  

1. Download [Cinder 0.8.5 Vanilla](http://libcinder.org/releases/cinder_0.8.5_mac.zip)
2. Unzip and rename the "cinder_0.8.5_mac" folder to "Cinder"
3. Place a copy of the [Freetype repository](https://github.com/arielm/Freetype) in `Cinder/blocks`
4. Place a copy of this repository in `Cinder/samples`

The folder hierarchy should look like:  
`Cinder`  
`|--blocks`  
`|..|--Freetype`  
`|--samples`  
`|..|--Unicode`  

**Running on OSX and iOS**

1. Enter the relevant folder in `Projects`
2. Open the relevant XCode project (under `osx` or `ios`)

Tested with OSX 10.7.5 and XCode 4.6.2.  
Tested with OSX 10.8.5 and XCode 5.0.2.  

**Running on Android**

Prerequisites:

1. [Safetydank's fork of Cinder](https://github.com/safetydank/Cinder)
2. [NDK r8e](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r8e-darwin-x86_64.tar.bz2)
3. [ADT 22.0.5](http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130729.zip)

Then:

1. Enter the relevant folder in `Projects`
2. Enter the `android` folder
3. Type `. ./setup-android` in Terminal and follow the instructions
